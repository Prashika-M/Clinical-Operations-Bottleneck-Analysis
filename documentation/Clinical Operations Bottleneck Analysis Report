Clinical Operations Bottleneck Analysis
Objective
This project aims to identify clinical bottlenecks in U.S. inpatient care using CMS DRG-level data.
The focus is on operational stress rather than cost alone, measuring how heavily hospitals are
burdened by specific clinical conditions.
Data Overview
The dataset includes hospital identifiers, DRG descriptions, discharge counts, and Medicare
payment information. Each record represents a hospital–DRG combination, enabling provider-level
normalization and aggregation.
Methodology
1. Aggregate discharges at the hospital–DRG level to normalize provider size.
2. Compute DRG-level metrics: hospital count, total discharges, and average discharges per
hospital.
3. Join payment data to contextualize operational load with financial impact.
4. Rank DRGs by average discharges per hospital to identify bottlenecks.
Key Findings
High-impact bottlenecks were dominated by septicemia, heart failure, and respiratory conditions.
These DRGs consistently impose high recurring operational load across hospitals.
Hospital & Regional Stress
Hospital-level and state-level analyses revealed uneven distribution of bottleneck pressure,
highlighting facilities and regions facing chronic capacity stress.
Composite Bottleneck Index
A weighted index combining normalized volume pressure and cost pressure was introduced to
reflect real-world prioritization between throughput and financial impact.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how structured SQL analytics can translate raw healthcare data into
actionable operational insights for capacity planning and policy decision-making.
